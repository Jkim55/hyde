## Hyde

* Ji and Colin's Hyde project

Initial scaffold for Turing's [Hyde Project](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/hyde/index.markdown)

You should put your code files in the `lib` directory. `bin/hyde` contains an executable you
can use to run your project.
